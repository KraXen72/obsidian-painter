# Painter
Paint text different colors

This plugin is wip and undergoing a big rewrite
currently, most of the source code is just [Highlightr-Plugin](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin). so use that plugin for now.

This plugin was inspired by my [css snippet & data.json](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin/issues/61) for the [Highlightr-Plugin](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin).
It's basically a rewrite/fork of that plugin, utilizing a lot of it's code - credit to @chetachiezikeuzor
